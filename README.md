TSiBA-Screensaver
=================

Commerce I.T. moved to sponsor a computer lab for the TSiBA education institution situated in Cape Town. A request was made for a personalised screensaver. The actual screensaver is a flash animation whilst the screensaver program uses Simple Screensaver 1.0 to display the flash animation.   Created by Craig Lotter, January 2006
